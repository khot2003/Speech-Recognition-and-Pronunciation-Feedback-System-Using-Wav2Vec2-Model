# Speech-Recognition-and-Pronunciation-Feedback-System-Using-Wav2Vec2-Model

#Introduction
Students learning English as a second language (ESL) often struggle with pronunciation. Existing tools provide generic feedback, which may not address individual speech patterns or regional accents. This project aims to develop a speech-to-text system that analyzes spoken input, transcribes it into text, and provides targeted feedback for pronunciation improvement.
